Challenges of the project 
I couldn't really find a solution to extending the boarders of the image view so that the blue edges won't show. Now looking back at it, it would have been more wise to give it no background at all. Alongside that the navigation tab for the superheros never really fit the screen completely well, especially on the right side.
